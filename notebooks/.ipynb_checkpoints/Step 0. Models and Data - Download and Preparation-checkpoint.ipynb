    "In this notebook we download and prepare the models and data required for the example use-case. \n",
    "\n",
    "To exemplify the end-to-end Domain Specific NeMo ASR application, we start with an acoustic model pre-trained on open-source English datasets [LibriSpeech](http://www.openslr.org/12) and [English - Mozilla Common Voice](https://voice.mozilla.org/en/datasets). Then we fine-tune the pre-trained acoustic and language models with **Wall Street Journal (WSJ)** news dataset. Through this example case, we show we can easily do transfer learning or domain adaptation from [relatively old] fiction books (LibriSpeech) to [relatively modern] business news (WSJ).\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps followed in this notebook are:\n",
    "1. Create a folder named `example_data` inside the `data directory` you input when starting the container.\n",
    "2. Get the `pre-trained` acoustic model from Nvidia GPU Cloud (NGC).\n",
    "3. Build a baseline Language Model (6-gram KenLM model trained on LibriSpeech)\n",
    "4. Download the WSJ trained models created by this application from NGC or alternatively the dataset for *acoustic model* and *language model* training (fine-tuning) and understand how to build NeMo ready datasets."
